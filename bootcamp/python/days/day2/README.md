# Day 2 - Numbers and Lists

**Date:** 2025-08-22  
**Week:** 1  
**Focus:** Introduction to numbers, arithmetic operations, and list manipulation

## üéØ Today's Goals

- [x] Learn basic arithmetic operations in Python
- [x] Work with constants and numbers in f-strings
- [x] Create and access list elements
- [x] Use list elements in string formatting
- [x] Practice list modification (insert, append, pop, del)
- [x] Master list sorting and ordering methods

## üìö Learning Objectives

### Exercise 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations
- **Objective:** Learn fundamental arithmetic operations in Python
- **Key Concepts:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- **Expected Output:** Results of basic mathematical calculations

### Exercise 2: Constants and F-String with Numbers
- **Objective:** Work with constants and integrate numbers into f-strings
- **Key Concepts:** Constants, f-string formatting with numeric variables
- **Expected Output:** Formatted string containing a number

### Exercise 3: List Creation and Indexing
- **Objective:** Create lists and access elements by index
- **Key Concepts:** List creation, zero-based indexing, element access
- **Expected Output:** List display and individual element access

### Exercise 4: List Elements in F-Strings
- **Objective:** Combine list elements with string formatting
- **Key Concepts:** List indexing in f-strings, string interpolation
- **Expected Output:** Personalized messages using list elements

### Exercise 5: List Modification and Guest Management
- **Objective:** Practice comprehensive list manipulation operations
- **Key Concepts:** insert(), append(), pop(), del, list modification
- **Expected Output:** Dynamic guest list management simulation

### Exercise 6: List Sorting and Ordering Methods
- **Objective:** Master list sorting and ordering techniques
- **Key Concepts:** sort(), sorted(), reverse(), temporary vs permanent sorting
- **Expected Output:** Lists in various sorted and ordered states

## üöÄ How to Run

```bash
# Run all exercises
python main.py

# Run specific exercise
python main.py --exercise 1

# Run all exercises explicitly
python main.py --all
```

## üìù Notes

### Key Learnings:
- Python arithmetic follows standard mathematical order of operations
- Lists are mutable data structures that can be modified in-place
- List indexing starts at 0 (zero-based indexing)
- List methods like append(), insert(), pop() modify the original list
- sorted() returns a new list, while sort() modifies the original
- F-strings can contain any valid Python expression, including list indexing

### Challenges Faced:
- Remembering the difference between sort() and sorted()
- Understanding when list methods modify in-place vs return new objects
- Managing list indices when adding/removing elements

### Insights:
- Lists are incredibly versatile for storing and manipulating data
- The guest management exercise demonstrates real-world list applications
- List sorting methods provide powerful data organization capabilities
