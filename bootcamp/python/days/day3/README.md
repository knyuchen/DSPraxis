# Day 3 - Loops, List Comprehensions, and Tuples

**Date:** 2025-08-23  
**Focus:** Introduction to loops, list comprehensions, range operations, and tuples

## üéØ Today's Goals

- [x] Learn for loops and iteration over lists
- [x] Practice list copying and modification
- [x] Master list slicing techniques
- [x] Understand list comprehensions and range operations
- [x] Work with tuples and understand immutability

## üìö Learning Objectives

### Exercise 1: For Loops and List Copying
- **Objective:** Learn for loops and proper list copying techniques
- **Key Concepts:** for loops, list iteration, shallow copying with [:]
- **Expected Output:** Iteration over lists and demonstration of independent list copies

### Exercise 2: For Loops and List Slicing
- **Objective:** Master list slicing and iteration techniques
- **Key Concepts:** list slicing [:], negative indexing, middle slices
- **Expected Output:** Different portions of lists using various slicing techniques

### Exercise 3: List Comprehensions and Range Operations
- **Objective:** Understand list comprehensions and range function
- **Key Concepts:** list comprehensions, range(), min(), max(), sum(), step values
- **Expected Output:** Generated lists and mathematical operations on large datasets

### Exercise 4: Tuples and Immutability
- **Objective:** Learn about tuples and their immutable nature
- **Key Concepts:** tuples, immutability, tuple reassignment
- **Expected Output:** Tuple iteration and demonstration of tuple reassignment

## üöÄ How to Run

```bash
# Run all exercises
python main.py

# Run specific exercise
python main.py --exercise 1

# Run all exercises explicitly
python main.py --all
```

## üìù Notes

### Key Learnings:
- For loops provide clean iteration over sequences
- List slicing [:] creates a shallow copy, not a reference
- List comprehensions are powerful for creating lists from expressions
- Range() function is essential for generating number sequences
- Tuples are immutable but can be reassigned to new values
- List comprehensions with step values enable efficient sequence generation

### Challenges Faced:
- Understanding the difference between list copying and referencing
- Remembering the syntax for list comprehensions
- Grasping the concept of tuple immutability vs reassignment

### Insights:
- List comprehensions are much more readable than equivalent for loops
- The range() function with step values is incredibly useful for DSP applications
- Proper list copying prevents unintended side effects
- Tuples provide data integrity when you need immutable sequences
