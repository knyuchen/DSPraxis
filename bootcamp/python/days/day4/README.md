## 📚 Learning Objectives

### Exercise 1: Boolean Comparisons and Logical Operators
- **Objective:** Practice boolean comparisons and understand logical operators
- **Key Concepts:** `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `in`, `not in`
- **Expected Output:** True/False values demonstrating comparison logic

### Exercise 2: If-Else Statements and Conditional Logic
- **Objective:** Master basic if-else conditional statements
- **Key Concepts:** `if`, `else`, conditional execution
- **Expected Output:** Different messages based on variable values

### Exercise 3: If-Elif-Else Chain for Age Classification
- **Objective:** Learn if-elif-else chains for multiple conditions
- **Key Concepts:** `if`, `elif`, `else`, age-based classification
- **Expected Output:** Age-appropriate classification messages

### Exercise 4: Conditional Checks with Lists
- **Objective:** Combine conditionals with list membership checks
- **Key Concepts:** `in` operator, list membership, conditional printing
- **Expected Output:** Messages for items found in lists

### Exercise 5: For Loops with Conditional Logic
- **Objective:** Integrate loops with conditional statements
- **Key Concepts:** `for` loops, `if` statements, list iteration
- **Expected Output:** Personalized messages for different user types

### Exercise 6: User Input Validation with Lists
- **Objective:** Practice input validation using list membership
- **Key Concepts:** List comparison, user validation, availability checking
- **Expected Output:** Username availability status messages

### Exercise 7: Conditional Logic with Ordinal Numbers
- **Objective:** Apply conditionals to create ordinal number suffixes
- **Key Concepts:** Number formatting, conditional suffixes, string formatting
- **Expected Output:** Numbers with proper ordinal suffixes (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)

### Exercise 8: Dictionary Creation and Access
- **Objective:** Learn dictionary creation and basic access methods
- **Key Concepts:** Dictionary syntax, key-value pairs, dictionary access
- **Expected Output:** Dictionary display and individual value access

### Exercise 9: Dictionary with Multiple Key-Value Pairs
- **Objective:** Work with dictionaries containing multiple entries
- **Key Concepts:** Dictionary structure, multiple keys, value retrieval
- **Expected Output:** Dictionary display and individual value access

### Exercise 10: Dictionary as a Simple Database
- **Objective:** Use dictionaries as simple data storage
- **Key Concepts:** Dictionary as database, key-value relationships, data retrieval
- **Expected Output:** Programming term definitions from dictionary

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
# Run all exercises
python main.py

# Run specific exercise
python main.py --exercise 1

# Run all exercises explicitly
python main.py --all
```

## 📝 Notes

### Key Learnings:
- Boolean comparisons return `True` or `False` values
- `if-elif-else` chains provide efficient multi-condition logic
- Dictionaries are excellent for storing related data as key-value pairs
- The `in` operator is powerful for checking list membership
- Conditional logic can be combined with loops for complex decision-making

### Challenges Faced:
- Understanding the difference between `==` (equality) and `=` (assignment)
- Remembering the proper syntax for dictionary key-value pairs
- Grasping the flow of if-elif-else chains

### Insights:
- Dictionaries are much more flexible than lists for storing structured data
- Conditional statements make code dynamic and responsive
- Boolean logic is fundamental to programming decision-making
- The combination of loops and conditionals creates powerful data processing capabilities
