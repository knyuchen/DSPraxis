## üìù Notes

### Key Learnings:
- Dictionary iteration with `.items()`, `.keys()`, and `.values()` provides powerful data access patterns
- Nested dictionaries allow for complex, structured data representation
- While loops with conditional logic create dynamic, interactive programs
- User input handling requires careful validation and error handling
- List operations like `.pop()` and `.remove()` are essential for data manipulation

### Challenges Faced:
- Understanding the difference between `.pop()` (removes and returns) and `.remove()` (removes by value)
- Managing complex nested data structures without losing track of the hierarchy
- Converting user input to appropriate data types (string to int)
- Designing loops that can handle both user interaction and automated processing

### Insights:
- Dictionaries with list values are excellent for one-to-many relationships
- While loops are perfect for interactive programs and list processing
- The combination of dictionaries and loops creates powerful data processing capabilities
- User input validation is crucial for robust program design
- Complex data structures become manageable with proper iteration techniques
