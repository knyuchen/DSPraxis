# Day 7 - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals

**Date:** 2025-08-29  
**Focus:** Classes, inheritance, composition, and advanced OOP concepts

## üéØ Today's Goals

- [x] Master basic class definition and instantiation
- [x] Learn class attributes, methods, and instance variables
- [x] Understand inheritance and method overriding
- [x] Practice composition and complex class relationships
- [x] Explore random number generation and algorithm implementation
- [x] Complete 6 comprehensive exercises covering OOP fundamentals

## üìö Learning Objectives

### Exercise 1: Basic Class Definition and Methods
- **Objective:** Learn to define classes with attributes and methods
- **Key Concepts:** Class definition, `__init__` method, instance attributes, instance methods
- **Expected Output:** Restaurant objects with name, cuisine type, and serving functionality

### Exercise 2: Class Attributes and Method Implementation
- **Objective:** Implement class methods and manage instance state
- **Key Concepts:** Instance methods, state management, attribute modification, method calls
- **Expected Output:** User objects with personal information and login tracking

### Exercise 3: Class Inheritance and Method Override
- **Objective:** Create child classes that inherit from parent classes
- **Key Concepts:** Inheritance, `super()` function, method overriding, class hierarchy
- **Expected Output:** Ice cream stand that inherits restaurant functionality

### Exercise 4: Composition and Complex Class Relationships
- **Objective:** Use composition to build complex class relationships
- **Key Concepts:** Composition, class relationships, privilege management, admin functionality
- **Expected Output:** Admin user with special privileges and capabilities

### Exercise 5: Random Number Generation and Class Methods
- **Objective:** Implement classes with random number generation capabilities
- **Key Concepts:** Random module, class methods, parameterized constructors, dice simulation
- **Expected Output:** Dice objects with configurable sides and random roll functionality

### Exercise 6: Complex Algorithm Implementation with Classes
- **Objective:** Build complex algorithms using OOP principles
- **Key Concepts:** Algorithm design, lottery simulation, ticket matching, probability
- **Expected Output:** Lottery ticket generation and matching system

## üöÄ How to Run

```bash
# Run all exercises
python main.py

# Run specific exercise
python main.py --exercise 1

# Run all exercises explicitly
python main.py --all
```

## üìù Notes

### Key Learnings:
- Class definition with `class` keyword creates blueprints for objects
- `__init__` method initializes instance attributes when objects are created
- Instance methods can access and modify object state through `self`
- Inheritance allows child classes to inherit attributes and methods from parent classes
- Composition enables building complex objects by combining simpler ones
- Random number generation adds unpredictability and simulation capabilities

### Challenges Faced:
- Understanding the difference between class attributes and instance attributes
- Grasping the concept of `self` and how it refers to the current instance
- Managing inheritance hierarchies and method overriding
- Designing class relationships using composition vs inheritance
- Implementing complex algorithms while maintaining clean OOP structure

### Insights:
- OOP provides a natural way to model real-world entities and relationships
- Inheritance promotes code reuse and establishes "is-a" relationships
- Composition enables "has-a" relationships and greater flexibility
- Instance methods can modify object state, making objects mutable and interactive
- Random number generation is essential for simulations and games
- Class design should prioritize clarity, reusability, and maintainability
